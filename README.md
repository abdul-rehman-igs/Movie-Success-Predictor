ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights:

Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw movie data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in genres, directors, and budgets.

Feature engineering for categorical data such as cast, crew, and production companies.

Machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for revenue prediction.

Model evaluation using RÂ² score, RMSE, and cross-validation.

Visualizations of insights with Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Business-oriented insights, such as how budget allocation and cast choices impact movie success.

ðŸ“Š Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
